### The Plan 

1. Download all time series, (later an update script that updates the dataset every day)
2. Pre-process them, (later automated etl pipeline)
3. Train a base-line model on chronos
4. Cluster algorithm
5. Train each cluster independently, (later continuous learning pipeline, on update time series)
6. Evaluate the performance
7. Fine tuning and feature engineering
