train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'h'.
Provided train_data has 23019 rows (NaN fraction=80.0%), 1 time series. Median time series length is 23019 (min=23019, max=23019). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'Close'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
